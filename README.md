# Heart_Disease_Prediction

Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. This project aims to create a predictive model using machine learning to determine whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical attributes. This could help in early diagnosis and treatment, potentially saving lives.

Objectives:
Build a machine learning model to predict heart disease.
Compare various classification algorithms to find the most accurate model.
Interpret model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters for optimization.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library
Pandas: Data manipulation
NumPy: Numerical computations
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization
